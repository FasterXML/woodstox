        <para>The <b>eyePhone</b> is a new type of mobile phones released by MomCorp and one of the
            products of Mom Store in 3010. It is called an eyePhone because it is located in the
            eyes of its users and displays a screen in front of them. The eyePhone has a lot of
            applications, such as Twit and can even make phone calls. Soon, everyone became addicted
            to their new eyePhones, and Mom activated a Twit-worm so that she could have between 1
            and 2 million zombies buying the machine's "upgraded" version, the eyePhone 2.0.</para>
